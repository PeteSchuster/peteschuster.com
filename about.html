<h1>About Pete Schuster</h1>

<img width="1024" height="683" src="/assets/images/about.jpg" class="col-1of2 alignright wp-post-image" alt="Pete Schuster" />

<p>I am a frontend web developer working in center city Philadelphia. I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia with my wife, <a href="https://www.shannoncollins.com/" target="_blank">Philadelphia Wedding Photographer</a>, Shannon, our daughter Adelaide, and several pets.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with my hands when I can. I&#8217;m interested in gardening, permaculture, and keeping our houseplants alive. I also enjoy woodworking and trying to become a better craftsman.</p>

<p>Bingeing TV shows, watching movies, listening to podcasts and Spotify, and playing video games fill out my other downtime.</p>

<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>This site has been several sites in the making. After attempting a couple sites prior, all with different messages, this site is meant to be the central source for everything from development news, to rants and raves on my ongoing adventures.</p>
